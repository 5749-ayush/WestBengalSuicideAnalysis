# WestBengalSuicideAnalysis
## An R-based analysis of suicide patterns and demographics in West Bengal (2001-2014).

## 📖 Project Overview
This project provides a statistical analysis of suicide data in West Bengal from 2001 to 2014, based on data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). The primary objective is to identify and visualize key trends, demographic vulnerabilities, and potential socio-economic correlates of suicide in the state.

The analysis is contained in the Suicide_project.R script, which performs data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization. Key findings and discussion are summarized in the accompanying report, WB Story Suicide.pdf.

## 📊 Key Findings
National Context: Between 2001 and 2014, West Bengal ranked fourth-highest in total suicides among all Indian states.

Gender Disparity: Males account for approximately twice as many suicides as females. This finding suggests that social expectations and economic responsibilities are significant contributing factors.

Vulnerable Occupations: Self-employed individuals and housewives recorded the highest suicide rates, indicating immense societal and familial pressures on these groups.

Temporal Trends: Yearly suicide numbers show significant fluctuation, with prominent spikes observed in the 2010–2011 period.

## 🧩 Technologies & Methods
### Language: R

Core Libraries: tidyverse (for ggplot2, dplyr, readr), summarytools, and stats.

Analysis: The script generates summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) and visualizations (line graphs, bar charts) to explore trends by year, gender, and occupation.

## ⚙️ How to Reproduce
 1) Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com//Suicide_Project_WB.git

2) Open Suicide_project.R in RStudio or your preferred R environment.

3) Install the required dependencies:

R : install.packages(c("tidyverse", "summarytools"))
4) Run the script to generate the analysis and visualizations.

## 🩺 Conclusion
The analysis indicates that economic distress, rigid gender norms, and occupational pressures are major correlates of suicide in West Bengal. The findings highlight the barrier that mental health stigma presents to intervention, particularly in rural India, and underscore the need for sustained policy action to support awareness initiatives.
